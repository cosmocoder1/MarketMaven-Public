# ðŸ“ˆ MarketMaven (Public Overview)

**MarketMaven** is a modular, research-grade breakout detection and analysis system. It is designed to vectorize, classify, and evaluate market behavior across a broad universe of financial instruments.

Built with precision, interpretability, and scale in mind, MarketMaven provides a foundation for exploring high-confidence pattern detection, signal ranking, and time-series forecasting using ensemble intelligence.

## ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

MarketMaven consists of modular components focused on signal evaluation, pattern mining, model training, and long-term recall. Core modules include:

| Module                | Purpose                                                                                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vector_store`        | Embeds and indexes setup fingerprints for high-dimensional recall                                    |
| `setup_scanner`       | Trains classification models on structured signal representations                                    |
| `vector_vault`        | Archives historically validated setups for future matching                                           |
| `signal_miner`        | Identifies structural price movements and extracts relevant features                                 |
| `feature_analysis`    | Scores features for statistical separability and predictive potential                                |
| `quantitative_core`   | Performs deeper metric evaluation on signal clusters and model ensembles                            |
| `backtester`          | Runs controlled validation on labeled market events and strategy candidates                         |
| `investor_ai`         | Conceptual module for learning-based strategy suggestions and autonomous analysis (in development)   |

## ðŸ§  System Philosophy

> *If breakouts can be detected through pattern recognition and context, machine learning can amplify that capability at scale.*

MarketMaven is not built for overfitting or prediction games. It is designed to:

- Detect **structural signals** and pre-breakout conditions  
- Filter globally using **robust purity standards**  
- Learn from consistent market behavior, not noise  
- Enable **live scanning and confidence-based output** across thousands of symbols
